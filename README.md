# Infrastructure Data Model (IDM)
The IDM, constructed similarly to [Observations Data Model](https://doi.org/10.1029/2007WR006392) (established by [CUAHSI](https://www.cuahsi.org/), is a SQL server database that uses relational tables to organize disparate types of data, as well as minimize database size and maximize data retrieval speed. The Villanova Center for Resilient Water Systems (VCRWS) has created this database to experiment with the organization of their data for deeper and more comprehensive spatio-temporal analysis. The relational format allows for an interface in which time series of dissimilar data from a range of projects can be retrieved and compared; however, the IDM has added additional tables to build on the [ODM structure](https://github.com/ODM2/ODM2) to focus on stormwater infrastructure data.
